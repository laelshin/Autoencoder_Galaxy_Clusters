# Autoencoder_Galaxy_Clusters

I worked on improving galaxy clustering based on observable data (2D position + line-of-sight velocity) using an Autoencoder. The Autoencoder was trained on pencil-beam segments from the Horizon Run 4 simulation.

Special thanks to Changhun Kim (AITRICS), Jubee Sohn (SNU), and Sungwook E. Hong (KASI) for their guidance and support.
